Current Wishlist:

1. GMRFs: 
	
	We want to implement the simulation and conditioning of GMRF's on a 
	(nested) mesh.
	
	TODO:
	
	a. migrate the kl_expansion to the gmrf class. 
	b. when initializing the field, specify the parametrization (kl, precision,
	   covariance, others?)
	c. implement pointwise conditioning (sample paths and field)
	d. implement conditioning on hard constraints (sample paths and field)
	e. implement conditioning on soft constraints (sample paths and field)
	f. multiscale by local averaging (fix), or via Willsky?


2. Function Class:

	We want to define nodal-, mesh-, and explicit functions separately. 
	This will make it easier to assemble, and to deal with different meshes, 
	and -elements.

	TODO: 

	a. initialize function [done]
	b. evaluate function and its derivatives  [done]
		i. move shape_eval from 'System' to 'Elements' class [done] 
		ii. allow for samples of functions (i.e. multiple columns) [done].
		iii. introduce piecewise constant elements. [done]
					
	
3. 1D Mesh: 

	Extend the quadmesh to include one dimensional meshes. 
	
	TODO:
	
	a. define the BiCell class (lots of functions!) [done]
	a.1. define BiNode class [done]
	b. change Mesh class to be dimensionally aware
	c. add 1D shape functions. [done]
	d. modify plot function 
	
	Node Class:
		copy
		grid_size
		max_depth
		traverse
		find_leaves (get_leaves)
		get_root 
		search_by_address (prev find_node) 
		has_children
		get_children
		has_parent
		get_parent
		mark
		unmark
		is_marked
		is_linked
		cell (change from quadcell)
		
	QuadNode
		is_balanced
		balance
		find_neighbor
	
	BiNode
		no hanging nodes -> no need to balance tree.
		find_neighbor
		
		

4. Generalized 2D Mesh: 

	Extend the QuadCell object to include trees of cells whose root cells
	arrangement is given by a more general connectivity matrix.
	
	TODO: 
	
	a. write a function that imports a mesh from a gmsh file (generalize 
	   'grid_size') [done].  
	b. resolve how to orient cells consistently (e.g. goin 'N' twice and then
	   'S' twice should get you back to the same cell. Perhaps loop over all 
	   elements and resolve all neighbors (and reciprocally)0.  
	c. Resolve this stupid problem with level 0 (the empty root). Maybe make
	   the initial refinement by default. 
	   
	d. Modify QuadCell, BiCell classes
		QuadCell:
			- consolidate map_to_reference, map_from_reference, and derivative_multiplier
			  into one function: reference_mapping  
			- use nodal basis functions to map from physical to reference cell.
			
		BiCell: 
			- reference_mapping: consolidates, map_to_reference, map_from_reference,
			  and derivative multiplier. 
			  
			  
		Node: Incorporate Grid object in Nodes
	
	
5. Merge Cells and Nodes (submeshes via tags)
	
	Instead of using Nodes for the tree structure and Cells for the physical structure,
	combine them. 
	
	TODO:
	
	a. Copy Node methods to Cells.
	
	b. Ensure
